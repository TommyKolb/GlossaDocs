This is a application called GlossaDocs. I'm running it using npm run dev. This opens a UI  inside cursor on http://localhost:5173/ which works, but when I try to access http://localhost:5173/ on my google chrome it can't connect. Why might this be?

You’re likely hitting a host-binding/proxy issue between Cursor’s embedded preview and your system Chrome. I’ll quickly check your dev script config to confirm whether the Vite server is bound only to an internal interface.
I confirmed your Vite config uses defaults (no explicit host), so the next likely cause is where the dev server is actually running (local Windows vs WSL/container/remote). I’ll quickly inspect the active terminal metadata to verify that.
netstat -ano | rg ":5173"
Cursor Sandbox is unsupported
curl.exe -I http://localhost:5173/
Cursor Sandbox is unsupported
Most likely cause: Cursor can proxy/preview a dev server that your external Chrome cannot reach directly.
From your terminal log, Vite is starting as:
Local: http://localhost:5173/
Network: use --host to expose
So it is not exposed beyond its default bind, and your attempts to pass --host weren’t actually reaching Vite (npm warned Unknown cli config "--host").
Why this happens
If Cursor is using any remote runtime context (WSL/SSH/container), localhost in Cursor preview is not necessarily the same localhost your Windows Chrome uses.
Your Vite server is currently not showing a network URL, so it’s not being exposed the way you expect.
What to try
Start Vite with host explicitly, bypassing npm arg confusion:
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
Or use npm with explicit arg passthrough:
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
Confirm startup output includes a Network URL.
In Chrome try:
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
and (if needed) http://<your-local-ip>:5173/
If still failing, check Chrome/proxy settings (some proxy configs do not bypass localhost).
If you want, I can help you choose the cleanest permanent script setup for package.json so this always works.
The npx vite command worked. Is there a way to make it so I can just do npm run dev? That would be simpler

package.json
+1
-1
    "build": "vite build",    "dev": "vite"  },
    "dev": "vite"    "build": "vite build",    "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0"  },
Yes—now npm run dev will work the same way.
I updated package.json so your dev script always exposes the server:
package.json: dev is now vite --host 0.0.0.0
You can now run:
npm run dev
and access it from Chrome at http://localhost:5173/ (or http://127.0.0.1:5173/).
If you want, I can also pin the port in the script (--port 5173) so it never auto-switches when occupied.
