Use the previous description and the following summary of conversations I had with potential users to create ten user stories for this product. Use the template: As a <user>, I want <action> so that <benefit>. Add an explanation of what each user story is really about. T-shirt estimate each user story. Each user story must fit integrally into a 2-week sprint. A

After my interviews, I feel like I have a better understanding of what should be my priority during this project. I learned from Users 1 and 2 about how non-Latin alphabets, or at least Chinese and Japanese, are typically typed. From those conversations, I think I’ve learned how I’ll have to treat distinct writing systems differently on the backend while still providing a consistent frontend where only the characters on the virtual keys change. As an aside, while doing research on the most common kinds of writing systems, I realized how many are used almost solely in India but still have tens or hundreds of millions of speakers, so I will have to educate myself on the similarities and differences between them. This leads into another major takeaway I got from these interviews, which is that I will have to do some serious linguistic research to ensure I provide a superior user experience for speakers of non-Latin-alphabet languages. 
	The most enthusiasm my interviewees showed in our conversations usually came when we discussed integrating keyboards for multiple languages, including programming and math, into a document software. Multiple people mentioned how useful that would have been in their high school language classes (including User 2, who is currently in a high school language class). This seemed to have been a common pain point, and people were genuinely interested in an easy and convenient solution. Although it was not my intention, people were also interested in having an easier way to type math and programming languages without having to use a purpose-built IDE or something with LaTeX. Although I might not have time to add these features, I do think it’s worth including a way to create something like a code block, which obeys different formatting rules than the rest of the document. This could be used for math, code, or a different language, and would prevent a lot of the hassle that usually comes from Google Docs trying to format something that is manifestly not standard English.  

Nice—this is a strong problem statement, and your interviews clearly point to concrete product decisions. Below are 10 user stories that stay grounded in what users actually told you, are scoped to fit within a 2-week sprint, and collectively form a believable MVP trajectory.

I’ll use S / M / L t-shirt sizing, assuming you’re working solo and being realistic about research + implementation time.

1. Integrated virtual keyboard for non-Latin scripts

User story

As a multilingual writer, I want an integrated on-screen keyboard for my target language so that I can type non-Latin characters without switching apps or keyboard layouts.

What this is really about
This is the core value proposition: eliminating context switching and setup friction. It validates that GlossaDocs is different at first interaction.

Estimate: M
(UI keyboard + basic input handling for one script, e.g. Greek or Cyrillic)

2. Language selection per typing session

User story

As a user, I want to explicitly select the language I’m typing in so that the keyboard layout and text handling match my intent.

What this is really about
Reducing ambiguity. Instead of guessing language from text (hard), you give users a clear, respectful control—especially important for learners.

Estimate: S
(Dropdown + state management)

3. Language-aware spell checking

User story

As a language learner, I want spell check to switch based on my selected language so that I get useful feedback instead of false errors.

What this is really about
Trust. Users abandon tools that constantly mark correct text as “wrong,” especially in non-English languages.

Estimate: M
(Integrating an existing spellcheck library for one non-English language)

4. Seamless frontend despite different writing systems

User story

As a user typing in different scripts, I want the typing experience to feel consistent even when the underlying writing system changes.

What this is really about
Abstraction. Your backend may treat Japanese, Chinese, and alphabetic scripts differently, but users shouldn’t feel that complexity.

Estimate: M
(Unifying input events + keyboard rendering logic)

5. Support for one complex input system (e.g. Japanese IME-style typing)

User story

As a Japanese learner, I want to type using a familiar phonetic input method so that I don’t need to relearn how typing works.

What this is really about
Credibility. Supporting at least one non-alphabetic system shows you understand real linguistic diversity, not just accented Latin text.

Estimate: L
(But still sprint-sized if scoped to a minimal, well-defined workflow)

6. Fast language switching while writing

User story

As a student switching between languages, I want to change languages quickly so that I can write mixed-language documents without friction.

What this is really about
Real classroom use. Language students frequently mix English instructions with target-language responses.

Estimate: S
(Keyboard shortcut or quick toggle)

7. Code / math block with different formatting rules

User story

As a student, I want to insert a special block for code or math so that it isn’t auto-formatted like normal English text.

What this is really about
Respecting intent. Users hate fighting “smart” formatting when they’re doing something intentionally non-prose.

Estimate: M
(Basic block type + monospace font + formatting isolation)

8. Language-specific keyboard visuals

User story

As a beginner, I want to see the characters on the virtual keys so that I can learn the layout as I type.

What this is really about
Lowering the learning curve. This directly addresses your complaint about downloaded keyboard layouts lacking visual feedback.

Estimate: S
(Key label rendering)

9. Default support for at least one less-commonly supported language

User story

As a speaker of a non-Western language, I want my language to be treated as a first-class option so that I don’t feel excluded by the tool.

What this is really about
Values encoded into the product. Supporting a language outside the “usual suspects” reinforces your mission and differentiates GlossaDocs.

Estimate: M
(Research + keyboard + basic spellcheck)

10. Clear indication of active language and input mode

User story

As a user, I want to always know which language and input mode I’m using so that I don’t accidentally type in the wrong system.

What this is really about
Error prevention. This avoids frustration and builds confidence, especially for learners and multilingual documents.

Estimate: S
(Status indicator in UI)

Big-picture note

These stories:

Are user-validated, not speculative

Can be ordered cleanly into early vs later sprints

Avoid boiling the ocean linguistically

Reinforce your “first-class multilingual” thesis at every layer

If you want, I can:

Prioritize these into Sprint 1 / 2 / 3

Help you define a true MVP cutoff

Rewrite these as acceptance-criteria-ready stories for Jira / Linear

Rank these stories by the INVEST criteria. Consider each letter in INVEST. Explain why each user story is ranked where it is. 

Great question—this is exactly how product stories should be stress-tested.

I’ll rank the 10 user stories from strongest to weakest against the INVEST criteria overall, then explain why each one lands where it does, explicitly referencing I-N-V-E-S-T tradeoffs.
(Important note: lower-ranked ≠ bad; it usually means “more coupled,” “riskier,” or “less sprint-friendly.”)

🥇 1. Clear indication of active language and input mode (Story 10)

Why it ranks highest

Independent: Doesn’t depend on complex backend logic.

Negotiable: UI placement and visuals are flexible.

Valuable: Prevents user error immediately.

Estimable: Very predictable effort.

Small: Easily fits a sprint.

Testable: Obvious pass/fail (“does the indicator update?”).

Why it wins
This is a textbook INVEST story: small, clear, valuable, and safe. Almost no ambiguity.

🥈 2. Fast language switching while writing (Story 6)

Independent: Can exist with minimal language support.

Negotiable: Shortcut vs toggle vs menu.

Valuable: High impact for multilingual users.

Estimable: Low uncertainty.

Small: UI + state change.

Testable: Switching behavior is easy to verify.

Why it’s high
High user value with low coupling and low risk—perfect sprint fuel.

🥉 3. Language selection per typing session (Story 2)

Independent: Core but not deeply coupled.

Negotiable: UI and behavior can evolve.

Valuable: Enables almost every other feature.

Estimable: Straightforward.

Small: Mostly state management.

Testable: Language change → observable effects.

Why not #1?
Slightly more foundational than the top two, but still very INVEST-clean.

4. Language-specific keyboard visuals (Story 8)

Independent: Builds on keyboard but not logic-heavy.

Negotiable: Visual design can change.

Valuable: Especially strong for learners.

Estimable: Mostly UI work.

Small: Render-only changes.

Testable: Visual correctness is clear.

Why here
Extremely solid story, just a bit less essential than language switching.

5. Integrated virtual keyboard for non-Latin scripts (Story 1)

Independent: Some dependency on editor input handling.

Negotiable: Keyboard layout and behavior can change.

Valuable: Core product promise.

Estimable: Moderate uncertainty.

Small: Borderline—can grow quickly if not scoped.

Testable: Input → correct character.

Why mid-tier
High value, but size and scope risk pull it down slightly on INVEST.

6. Code / math block with different formatting rules (Story 7)

Independent: Some coupling to editor architecture.

Negotiable: Very flexible definition.

Valuable: Strong secondary use case.

Estimable: Medium risk (editor quirks).

Small: Only if tightly scoped.

Testable: Formatting isolation is verifiable.

Why here
Valuable but not core to your primary user pain, and easy to overscope.

7. Language-aware spell checking (Story 3)

Independent: Depends on language selection and tooling.

Negotiable: Dictionary source, strictness, UI.

Valuable: Huge for trust.

Estimable: Depends heavily on libraries.

Small: Can be, but often expands.

Testable: Harder due to linguistic edge cases.

Why it drops
Still valuable, but estimability and testability are weaker than earlier stories.

8. Seamless frontend across writing systems (Story 4)

Independent: Not really—this is cross-cutting.

Negotiable: More of a design principle than a feature.

Valuable: Yes, but indirectly.

Estimable: Hard to scope.

Small: No—this spans multiple systems.

Testable: Subjective (“feels consistent”).

Why low
This is a great engineering goal, but a poor standalone user story by INVEST standards.

9. Support for one less-commonly supported language (Story 9)

Independent: Depends on infrastructure.

Negotiable: Which language, depth of support.

Valuable: Strong mission alignment.

Estimable: Research-heavy uncertainty.

Small: Risk of ballooning.

Testable: Hard without fluent validation.

Why near the bottom
High moral/product value, but high uncertainty and coupling.

🟥 10. Support for one complex input system (e.g. Japanese IME) (Story 5)

Independent: Highly coupled to input logic.

Negotiable: Limited—IME expectations are rigid.

Valuable: Extremely valuable to specific users.

Estimable: Hardest to estimate.

Small: Borderline L even when scoped.

Testable: Requires domain expertise.

Why last
This is the least INVEST-compliant, even though it’s strategically important. It’s a later-stage story, not an early sprint one.

Big takeaway

Your strongest INVEST stories:

Are interaction-level, not linguistic

Reduce user error and friction

Avoid deep backend complexity

Your weakest INVEST stories:

Are cross-cutting or research-heavy

Encode ambiguous success criteria

Depend on deep linguistic correctness

If you want, I can:

Rewrite the bottom 3 to be more INVEST-compliant

Turn this ranking into a Sprint 1–3 roadmap

Help you justify deprioritization in a design review or write-up

Throw out the five lowest ranked user stories. The top 5 will form a roadmap for my development process, so they should include everything major that is needed to make this product. Modify them slightly if necessary, but keep them mostly the same if possible. Write them out in a table format. 

Love this move—this is exactly how you turn interviews + theory into a sane MVP.

Below is a cleaned-up Top 5 roadmap, based on the highest INVEST-ranked stories. I’ve made very light modifications where needed to ensure the set is complete and coherent as a development sequence, without bloating scope.

These five together cover:

Core multilingual value

User control & visibility

Actual text input (not just UI chrome)

A believable end-to-end writing experience

GlossaDocs MVP Roadmap (Top 5 User Stories)
Rank	User Story	Explanation (What it’s really about)	T-Shirt Size
1	As a user, I want to always see which language and input mode is active so that I don’t accidentally type in the wrong system.	Prevents user error and builds confidence. This is essential once multiple languages and keyboards exist, and it’s a cheap way to dramatically improve usability.	S
2	As a multilingual writer, I want to quickly switch the active language while writing so that I can work naturally in mixed-language documents.	Enables realistic usage patterns (class notes, translations, instructions + responses). This is core to your classroom and learner use cases.	S
3	As a user, I want to explicitly select the language I intend to type in so that the keyboard and text handling match my intent.	Establishes the core interaction model: user intent drives behavior, not guesswork. This underpins keyboards, spellcheck, and formatting.	S
4	As a multilingual writer, I want an integrated on-screen keyboard for a non-Latin alphabet so that I can type special characters without switching apps or layouts.	This is the defining feature of GlossaDocs. Without it, the product collapses into “Docs, but slightly different.”	M
5	As a beginner language learner, I want the virtual keyboard to visually show the characters I’m typing so that I can learn the layout as I write.	Turns a utility feature into a learning tool. This directly addresses the pain point you personally experienced with downloaded keyboard layouts.	S
Why this roadmap works

Every story is INVEST-strong and sprint-sized

No story depends on heavy linguistic research or IME complexity

Together they form a complete loop:

Choose language

See language

Type with correct characters

Switch smoothly

Avoid mistakes

What’s intentionally not included (yet)

Spellcheck

Complex IMEs (Japanese/Chinese)

Code/math blocks

Rare-language support

Those all become credible Phase 2 extensions once the interaction model proves itself.

If you want, next we can:

Order these into Sprint 1 / Sprint 2

Define acceptance criteria for each

Translate this into a technical architecture sketch so you don’t paint yourself into a corner

I don't see anything here about actually making the document software. Make sure that the five user stories include the entire development process. Each story should be very roughly two-week sized. Keep that format with explanations and sizing

Ah — this is a great catch, and you’re 100% right. What you had before was a feature roadmap, not a product roadmap. If these five stories are the entire development plan, one of them must explicitly cover “there is a document editor at all.”

Below is a revised Top 5 MVP roadmap where:

Every story is ~2-week sized

Together they cover editor → multilingual input → usability

None of them are hand-wavy or purely UI polish

The scope is realistic for a solo developer

I’ve kept the original intent wherever possible, but elevated each story to cover a whole slice of the product.

GlossaDocs MVP Roadmap (End-to-End)
Rank	User Story	Explanation (What it’s really about)	T-Shirt Size
1	As a writer, I want a basic document editor where I can create, edit, and save a text document so that I can actually write and return to my work.	This is the foundation: text editing, cursor movement, basic formatting, and persistence. Without this, none of the language features matter.	L
2	As a user, I want to select the language I intend to type in so that the editor can adapt its behavior to my intent.	Establishes the core interaction model that everything else builds on. This includes language state, UI selection, and internal representation.	M
3	As a multilingual writer, I want an integrated on-screen keyboard for a non-Latin alphabet so that I can type special characters directly inside the editor.	Implements GlossaDocs’ defining feature: custom input tightly coupled to the editor, not an external tool.	M
4	As a user, I want to quickly switch languages and always see the currently active language so that I don’t make mistakes while writing multilingual documents.	Combines fast switching and visibility into one cohesive UX slice. Prevents user error and enables real-world usage.	S–M
5	As a language learner, I want the virtual keyboard to visually reflect the characters being typed so that I can learn the layout as I write.	Turns the keyboard from a utility into a learning aid, directly addressing the pain point discovered in interviews.	S
Why this set works as a complete development plan

Story 1 builds a real document editor

Story 2 defines the language-aware mental model

Story 3 delivers the core differentiator

Story 4 makes the product usable in practice

Story 5 reinforces your educational value proposition

Nothing here assumes:

Collaboration

Advanced IMEs

Spellcheck

Rich formatting

…but nothing here blocks adding those later either.

Reality check

This is roughly 10 weeks of focused work, which aligns with:

Solo developer

Part-time effort

Personal project with ambition but restraint

If you want, next we can:

Break Story 1 into internal subtasks (editor vs persistence vs UI)

Map this to a technical stack (ProseMirror? Slate? Custom?)

Identify the first demo-worthy milestone so you can show progress early

Prioritize the remaining 5 user stories into a product backlog. Assign the user stories to be accomplished to one of the next 5 2-week-long sprints (10 weeks of work)

Nice — now we’re squarely in product-owner mode. I’ll turn the 5 stories into a realistic backlog and lay them out across five 2-week sprints, with clear reasoning for why each goes where it does.

I’ll assume:

Solo developer

Part-time but consistent

Goal: working MVP at the end of Sprint 5

GlossaDocs Product Backlog & Sprint Plan (10 Weeks)
Sprint 1 (Weeks 1–2): Core editor foundation

User Story

As a writer, I want a basic document editor where I can create, edit, and save a text document so that I can actually write and return to my work.

Why this sprint

Everything else depends on this.

You need a real surface to test language input early.

Biggest technical risk → handle it first.

Sprint goal

“I can open GlossaDocs, type text, and reopen my document later.”

Key outcomes

Editable text area

Cursor movement & selection

Basic persistence (local storage or simple backend)

Sprint 2 (Weeks 3–4): Language intent & internal model

User Story

As a user, I want to select the language I intend to type in so that the editor can adapt its behavior to my intent.

Why here

Establishes the core abstraction early.

Forces you to model language state correctly before keyboards exist.

Reduces rework later.

Sprint goal

“The editor understands that text is being typed in a specific language.”

Key outcomes

Language selection UI

Internal representation of active language

Editor reacts to language changes (even if minimally)

Sprint 3 (Weeks 5–6): Integrated virtual keyboard

User Story

As a multilingual writer, I want an integrated on-screen keyboard for a non-Latin alphabet so that I can type special characters directly inside the editor.

Why here

Core differentiator of the product.

Now you have editor + language state → keyboard can hook in cleanly.

Early enough to validate your main hypothesis.

Sprint goal

“I can type real non-Latin characters without leaving the editor.”

Key outcomes

Rendered virtual keyboard

Key → character mapping

Keyboard input inserts text correctly into the document

Sprint 4 (Weeks 7–8): Language switching & visibility

User Story

As a user, I want to quickly switch languages and always see the currently active language so that I don’t make mistakes while writing multilingual documents.

Why here

Builds directly on the keyboard work.

Improves usability enough for realistic documents.

Low risk, high polish at the right moment.

Sprint goal

“I can confidently write in multiple languages in one session.”

Key outcomes

Fast language switching (button or shortcut)

Persistent language indicator

Keyboard updates instantly on switch

Sprint 5 (Weeks 9–10): Keyboard as a learning tool

User Story

As a language learner, I want the virtual keyboard to visually reflect the characters being typed so that I can learn the layout as I write.

Why last

Enhances (not enables) core functionality.

Perfect final sprint: UX-heavy, lower architectural risk.

Polishes your value proposition for demos and write-ups.

Sprint goal

“The keyboard teaches as well as types.”

Key outcomes

Character labels on keys

Clear visual feedback

Beginner-friendly typing experience

Backlog Summary Table
Sprint	Weeks	User Story Focus	Risk Level
1	1–2	Basic document editor	High
2	3–4	Language intent & state	Medium
3	5–6	Integrated keyboard	Medium
4	7–8	Language switching & visibility	Low
5	9–10	Learning-oriented keyboard visuals	Low
Final sanity check

By the end of Sprint 5, you have:

A real document editor

Multilingual input without OS hacks

Clear language intent and switching

A distinct educational edge

That’s a legitimate MVP, not a demo toy.

If you want next:

I can turn each sprint into acceptance criteria

Help you choose an editor framework that won’t fight keyboards

Or help you write this up as a design doc / project proposal

Great, this works. Can you now give me the five user stories you eliminated and the reasons they weren't deemed as important?

Glad this is landing well 🙂
Below are the five user stories that were eliminated, along with clear, product-driven reasons they didn’t make the 10-week MVP roadmap. Importantly, none of these are “bad ideas” — they’re just Phase 2+ features once the core interaction model is proven.

Eliminated User Stories & Rationale
1. Language-aware spell checking

User story

As a language learner, I want spell check to switch based on my selected language so that I get useful feedback instead of false errors.

Why it was deprioritized

High implementation complexity relative to MVP value

Depends on:

Language selection

Reliable dictionaries

Linguistically correct edge-case handling

Hard to make good quickly — bad spellcheck hurts trust more than none

Why it’s not essential for MVP

Users can still type correctly without spellcheck

Your core value is input, not correction

This is a strong follow-on feature once typing works flawlessly

When it comes back

Phase 2, after keyboard + language model stabilize

2. Code / math block with special formatting rules

User story

As a student, I want to insert a special block for code or math so that it isn’t auto-formatted like normal English text.

Why it was deprioritized

Expands the scope from “document editor” to “rich structured editor”

Introduces:

Block models

Cursor edge cases

Formatting interactions

Not directly tied to multilingual typing

Why it’s not essential for MVP

It’s a nice extension, not a requirement

The editor can remain plaintext-focused initially

Adds cognitive and technical overhead too early

When it comes back

Phase 2, once the editor model is stable

3. Seamless frontend across different writing systems

User story

As a user typing in different scripts, I want the typing experience to feel consistent even when the underlying writing system changes.

Why it was deprioritized

This is a design principle, not a discrete feature

Spans multiple systems:

Keyboard

Editor

Language model

Difficult to estimate and test objectively

Why it’s not essential for MVP

Consistency emerges naturally if the core interactions are well designed

Trying to “build this explicitly” early leads to overengineering

When it comes back

Continuously, as a guiding principle rather than a backlog item

4. Support for one less-commonly supported language

User story

As a speaker of a non-Western language, I want my language to be treated as a first-class option so that I don’t feel excluded.

Why it was deprioritized

Requires significant linguistic research

High risk of:

Incorrect assumptions

Incomplete support

Difficult to validate without fluent testers

Why it’s not essential for MVP

MVP only needs one well-supported non-Latin language

Quality beats breadth early on

Expanding language coverage too soon dilutes focus

When it comes back

Phase 2 or 3, once the system is proven extensible

5. Support for a complex input system (e.g. Japanese IME-style typing)

User story

As a Japanese learner, I want to type using a familiar phonetic input method so that I don’t need to relearn how typing works.

Why it was deprioritized

Highest technical and conceptual complexity

Requires:

Composition states

Candidate selection

Domain-specific UX expectations

Hard to do partially without frustrating users

Why it’s not essential for MVP

It’s a deep specialization, not a baseline requirement

Alphabetic and near-alphabetic scripts already validate the core idea

This would dominate your schedule if tackled too early

When it comes back

Phase 3+, after strong architectural confidence

Big-picture takeaway

You didn’t cut features — you cut risk and ambiguity.

Your MVP now:

Proves the core hypothesis

Delivers a real, usable product

Leaves clear, exciting growth paths

If you want next, I can:

Map these eliminated stories into a Phase 2 roadmap

Help you justify the cuts in a design review or write-up

Show how to architect Sprint 1–3 so these features remain easy to add later

Can you list out the ten user stories, separating the five you cut the final five you chose, along with their explanations, sizes, and what sprint they are assigned to

Absolutely — here’s the full, clean picture of all ten user stories, clearly split into:
